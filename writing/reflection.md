# Reflection by Brandon Kallams

We first started lab 6 last Thursday October 5th. Last Thursday, I completed
the first two steps of the lab. In those steps, I read in and displayed the
chosen DNA string, then I computed the complement of the DNA strand. I then
printed out the dna strand and its complement. When computing the complement, I
did the complement as capital letters and the original as lower case letters,
so at each step I could tell the difference between replaced letters and
original letters. After that, I was finished for the day.

Now, on today October 12th, I am starting step three first. For step three I
wrote a series of if and else if statements in order to choose a random DNA
letter to insert into the dna strand. I chose to insert that randomly chosen
letter at the beginning of the strand. Then, for step four, I created a integer
variable to randomly choose one of the letters in the given DNA string. The
randomly chosen letter is then deleted and the resulting DNA string is
displayed. Lastly, for step five, I kind of combined steps three and four. I
again generated a random number. Then I randomly chose a position in the DNA
string and deleted the letter that currently existed in that spot and added in
the letter I had randomly generated. I then displayed the new DNA string with
the position where the swapping took place labled as such.

Lab 6 went relatively smooth for me, however where I neede the most help was
randomly determing the positions where the mutations should take place. Once, I
asked a ta for help, I was able to figure it out and continue to roll on my
way.
